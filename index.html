               <h3>I'm a Junior Web Developer.</h3>
                In my pursuit of new creative endeavour in the coding and web development profession I have set some progressive goals for myself.
                My short term goal, I would like to gain as much experience and knowledge about coding as a Junior Web Developer because to me computer programming is an essential skill to learn and have.
                In the long term I would just want to have as much experience as I possibly can so that I could give back some of my knowledge to the generations after me and I think that is my main focus and goal.
